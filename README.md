# arch-script

This script was made for the exclusive purpose of automating my own personal installation of Arch Linux in my machines.
<br>
If you stumbled upon this repository looking for a general purpose installation script for Arch, although some things might be helpful, I strongly discourage you to replicate it.
<br>
Instead, follow the instructions in the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide">Arch Wiki Installation Guide</a>, along with other sections you find necessary.
